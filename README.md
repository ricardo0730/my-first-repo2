# My First Repo:Learning Python
I am currently learning how to write Python code. This repository includes the resources I have found most helpful for learning Python. I will also include the Python projects I create while I am learning.
## Resources for Learning Python
I started learning Python by completing the ["Try It: Intro to Python"](https://www.edx.org/course/intro-python) course on edX. I am keeping a list of other resources I have found helpful in [this file](my-first-repo/python_coding_resources.md). I will keep updating this list as I learn more.
## Python Projects
Here are the Python projects I have completed so far:

* **[Hello World](my-first-repo/hello_world)**, a basic Python program that prints text.

I will add additional projects to this repo as I complete them.
